# 3D-platform-controller
3D platformer controller written in GDscript. features movement, jumping, double jumping, and projectile shooting. can be adapted to use a global HP system. also features screenshots for the player and projectile scenes with all necessary nodes for the scripts to work properly.

Best to use as a base for 3D movement only, possibly with projectiles as a bonus. Code other than the base movement features is sometimes messy and may only work in certain scenarios.
